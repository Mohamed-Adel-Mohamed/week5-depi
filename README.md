This week 5 at Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative - DEPI | penteration testing track , I explored the stages of penetration testing and methodologies:
1️⃣ Stages:
Reconnaissance: Gather intel.
Scanning: Map the system.
Exploitation: Find and exploit vulnerabilities.
Persistence: Simulate ongoing access.
Reporting: Share findings and fixes.
2️⃣ Methodologies:
White-Box: Full access for in-depth testing.
Black-Box: No prior knowledge, like an outsider.
Grey-Box: Partial access for a balanced view.
